# HPCS terraform module

Provisions an instance of Hyper Protect Crypto Service (HPCS) in the account.

## Example usage

```terraform-hcl
module "dev_infrastructure_hpcs" {
  source = "github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/terraform-ibm-key-hpcs?ref=v1.0.0"

  resource_group_name = module.dev_cluster.resource_group_name
  resource_location   = module.dev_cluster.region
  cluster_id          = module.dev_cluster.id
  namespaces          = []
  namespace_count     = 0
  name_prefix         = var.name_prefix
  tags                = []
  plan                = "standard"
  service_endpoints      = var.service_endpoints
  number_of_crypto_units = var.number_of_crypto_units
}
```

## Post-provisioning steps

After the HPCS instance has been provisioned it must be manually initialized before it can be used to encrypt services and volumes. The following provides a summary of the steps required to initialize the Hyper Protect instance. Please refer https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm for more detail.

![HPCS initialization](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/eaa381661ad91d7720185625ae7b5a047a6dc41c/hs-crypto//image/hsm_initialization_flow.svg)

### 1. Install the TKE CLI plug-in

Install the `tke` plug-in for the IBM Cloud cli:

```shell
ibmcloud plugin install tke
```

**Note:** If you have previously installed the plug-in you can update to the latest with the following:

```shell
ibmcloud plugin update tke
```

### 2. Set up the TKE environment

Set the `CLOUDTKEFILES` environment variable on your workstation to specify the directory where you want to save the master key part files and signature key files. The signature keys are used to sign TKE administrative commands.

```shell
export CLOUDTKEFILES=<local directory>
```

On the LinuxÂ® operating system or MacOS, that line can be added to the `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` file if you want the setting to persist across terminal sessions.

### 3. Log in to IBM Cloud with the CLI

Log into the region and resource group where the HPCS instance has been provisioned. If you are authenticating with your IBM Cloud API Key, the command would look like:

```shell
ibmcloud login --apikey "${APIKEY}" -r "${REGION}" -g "${RESOURCE_GROUP}"
```

### 4. List the crypto units for the HPCS instance

Run the following command to list the crypto units that have been provisioned for the HPCS instance.

```shell
ibmcloud tke cryptounits
```

**Note:** If there are no crypto units available on the HPCS instance, follow the steps below in section X to add new crypto units.

### 5. Create the signature key

The following commands will add a signature key for the administrators of the HPCS instance. The first user added will be the overall admin of the instance. At least two administrators should be added to the instance.

#### 5.1 Add each user to the instance

1. Run the `sigkey-add` command - `ibmcloud tke sigkey-add`
2. Provide the name of the administrator when prompted
3. Provide a password for the administrator user

#### 5.2 Associate the signature key to the crypto units

1. Select the signature keys - `ibmcloud tke sigkey-sel`
2. Provide the numbers for the signature keys at the prompt. E.g. `1 2` to select the first and second signature keys.
3. Associate the signature key with the crypto unit - `ibmcloud tke cryptounit-admin-add`
4. Enter the number for the crypto unit and provide the password for the user

### 6. Set the Crypto Unit Threshold

## List the service instances and crypto units

To display the service instances and crypto units in the target resource group under the current user account, use the following command:

```shell
ibmcloud tke cryptounits
```
